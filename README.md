## Why?
I love solutions like F.lux for dealing with working on late nights, but one thing that it doesn't solve is brightness.
Sometimes when working late nights, I need to lower my brightness. But guess what? I've got to individually adjust each monitor to the right setting.
And now, in the morning, I've got to do it all over again. I might just be lazy, but I needed a solution to this ever infuriating problem.
And now, DCR (Dynamic Contrast Ratio), the thing most people turn off because it's annoying when you're just trying to use your computer normally.
But when I'm watching a video or playing a game, It looks so much better. 

## Running the app
Until I have an executable ready, just run main.py

## Prerequisites 
- Python 3.9 (should still work on some older versions)
- Windows 10 or above (packages used have not been tested on MacOS or Linux, though I may add support later)
### Package installation
In the directory of the project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
